- Secured with JWT authentication
- Links new Seller entity to authenticated user
- Validates sellername uniqueness
- Returns created Seller entity

### ✅ 3. ProductService
- Created `ProductService.java` with product management logic
- Handles product CRUD operations
- Manages inventory updates (simulated)
- Validates product ownership by sellers
- Implements product file handling (simulated)

### ✅ 4. Product CRUD Endpoints
Created secured endpoints for seller product management:

- **POST /api/products** - Create new product
  - Automatically links to authenticated seller
  - Creates ProductFiles from fileKeys (simulated)
  - Initializes inventory with 0 quantity
  
- **PUT /api/products/{pid}** - Update product
  - Verifies seller ownership
  - Updates product details and files
  
- **DELETE /api/products/{pid}** - Delete product
  - Verifies seller ownership
  - Cascades to ProductFiles and Inventory
  
- **POST /api/products/{pid}/inventory** - Set inventory
  - Simulated inventory management
  - Updates qtyonhand for product

### ✅ 5. Product Public Endpoints
Created public endpoints for browsing:

- **GET /api/products** - Get all products (paginated)
  - Supports page and size query parameters
  - Returns Spring Data Page with pagination metadata
  
- **GET /api/products/{pid}** - Get single product
  - Includes ProductFiles and Inventory info
  - Returns detailed ProductResponse DTO
  
- **GET /api/products/seller/{sid}** - Get seller's products
  - Lists all products for a specific seller
  - Public access for portfolio viewing

### ✅ 6. ProductFiles (Simulation)
- Implemented simulated file upload functionality
- Accepts list of fileKeys (strings) in ProductRequest
- Creates ProductFiles entities with:
  - fileKey: Simulated file reference
  - fileType: Defaults to "product_image"
  - fileFormat: Extracted from file extension
- No actual file storage (as per project requirements)

## Dependencies Added

Updated `pom.xml` with:
- `spring-boot-starter-validation` - For DTO validation
- `spring-boot-starter-security` - For Spring Security
- `jjwt-api`, `jjwt-impl`, `jjwt-jackson` - For JWT token handling

## Security Configuration

Updated `SecurityConfig.java`:
- Public GET access to `/api/products/**`
- Public GET access to `/api/sellers/{sid}`
- Protected access for all POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- Seller ownership validation in service layer

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Seller Registration

- Simulated file management with ProductFiles
- Inventory tracking (simplified)

### 3. Public Product Browsing
- Anyone can view products without login
- Pagination support for product listings
- Detailed product views with images and inventory
- Seller portfolio views

### 4. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
Created comprehensive DTOs:
- **SellerRegistrationRequest**: For seller signup
- **ProductRequest**: For product creation/updates
- **InventoryRequest**: For inventory management
- **ProductResponse**: Rich product data for clients

### 5. Validation
Implemented Jakarta Validation:
- Required field validation
- String length constraints
- Numeric range validation
- Custom error messages
